                    Apple&nbsp;Gift&nbsp;Card. Trade-in value may be applied toward qualifying new device purchase, or
                    added to an Apple&nbsp;Gift&nbsp;Card. Actual value awarded is based on receipt of a qualifying
                    device matching the description provided when estimate was made. Sales tax may be assessed on full
                    value of a new device purchase. In-store trade-in requires presentation of a valid photo ID (local

                    trade-in partners reserve the right to refuse or limit quantity of any trade-in transaction for any
